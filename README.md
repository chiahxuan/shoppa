# shoppa-2020
A group assignment that required us to apply the knowledge of AJAX and Bootstrap 4 that's been taught in this course. On this assessment we've chose to create a website that focused on selling the technological products such as phone and laptop. The assessment is not much of a hard task to handle with as I've self-learned the concept of AJAX and Bootstrap 4 in my previous project like Meal-Debit System in 2019. With that, the assessment allowed me to obtain more experience from implementing these concepts, and deepened my knowledge of AJAX and Bootstrap 4 from this course.
